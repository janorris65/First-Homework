Editing Horiseon Website

## Description
The code was 'div' and 'class' heavy. I added sematic elements to give the html code some expected output from the code to the final product. Everything was differentiated with a 'class' and each 'class' was treated individually in the CSS file.
Cleaning up the code made it more efficient in its typing.
